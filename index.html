                        <div class="details__body">
                    <p>
                        During my internship at Stellar Services, I had the opportunity to be a part of a dynamic 
                        software engineering team that focused on developing mobile applications using React Native. Here's a snapshot of my contributions and learnings:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        React Native Development: Delved deep into the intricacies of React Native, resulting in the successful deployment of both iOS and Android builds of our 
                        application. While I had exposure to both platforms, I predominantly concentrated on optimizing and enhancing the Android side of the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Integration with Azure Auth: Worked with the Azure authentication mechanism, ensuring seamless and secure sign-in experiences for our users. 
                        This involved both implementation and troubleshooting to keep the user data safe and the sign-in process swift.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Utilizing TypeScript: Adopted TypeScript for our project, which added a layer of type safety and enhanced code readability.
                        This helped in minimizing runtime errors and improved the maintainability of the codebase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        API Integration: Collaborated closely with the backend team to integrate APIs hosted on SharePoint.
                        This involved careful parsing, error-handling, and ensuring efficient data transmission between the frontend and backend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UI Design Collaboration: Teamed up with our talented UI/UX designers to transform wireframes and mockups into functional and visually appealing app interfaces.
                        Played a key role in ensuring that the design principles were adhered to throughout the development phase.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Teamwork: Engaged in daily stand-ups, brainstorming sessions, and code reviews. 
                        This not only fortified the application's robustness but also enriched my collaborative and communication skills.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Throughout this journey, I improved my problem-solving skills, learned to manage time effectively, and understood the significance of feedback and iterative improvement. 
                        Grateful for this hands-on experience, I am now more equipped and excited to venture further into the software world.
                    </p>
